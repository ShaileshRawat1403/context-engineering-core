# Ordering Scripts

Illustrative demos for ordering and precedence. These scripts are **for demonstration** only and should remain small and dependency-light.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Input[Admitted Context] --> Script[Ordering Demo]
    Script --> Output[Ordered Context]
```

Authoritative guidance remains in the ordering spec and skills.
