# Accountability — Index

Accountability makes **ownership, decision rights, and consequences explicit**.

This section will define:
- who owns each control, check, and acceptance decision
- how decisions and trade-offs are recorded
- how to trace responsibility for failures and remediation

Accountability documents ensure that governance is enforceable, not advisory.
