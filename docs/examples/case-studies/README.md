# Case Studies

Concrete field scenarios showing how the core controls were applied, what failed, and what changed.

- Documentation Assistant — doc-generation agent that drifted and was corrected with selection + validation + isolation.
- Incident Response Agent — noisy, time-pressured workflow stabilized with masking + ordering + human review gates.

Each case includes context, failure signals, the controls applied, and observable outcomes. These are narrative, not runnable, but they map directly to the executable examples.
