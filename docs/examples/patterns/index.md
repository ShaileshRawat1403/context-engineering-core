# Patterns — Overview

Reusable execution patterns distilled from field implementations. Each pattern names the failure signals it addresses and the controls it relies on.

- [Retrieval & RAG](retrieval-and-rag.md) — gating, ordering, budget enforcement.
- [Long-Running Context](long-running-context.md) — compression, deduplication, scope resets.
- [Multi-Agent Orchestration](multi-agent-orchestration.md) — isolation, authority ordering, validation.
- [Tool-Using Agent](tool-using-agent.md) — masking, provenance, cross-tool validation.

Patterns map directly to the runnable examples and skills; use them as starting points for system design.
