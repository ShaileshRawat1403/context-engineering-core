# Governance — Index

Governance defines **who owns decisions, what evidence is required, and how authority is enforced**.

Controls without governance are optional; governance makes them binding.

This section anchors review, acceptance, escalation, and accountability for all context-engineered systems.

Current coverage: index + process docs per subdomain. Additional checks/examples can be added if governance expands.
