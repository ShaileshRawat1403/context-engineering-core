# Escalation — Index

Escalation defines **when and how execution must stop and transfer to higher authority**.

This section will clarify:
- triggers that mandate escalation (validation failure, boundary breach, unchecked risk)
- roles authorized to receive and act on escalations
- required artifacts to accompany an escalation

Escalation documents enforce stop conditions; they prevent silent drift past governance boundaries.
