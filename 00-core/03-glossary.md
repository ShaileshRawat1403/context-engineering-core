# Glossary

This page moved to `glossary/index.md` to keep the glossary in a dedicated directory.

Please update bookmarks and references to the new location:

- Current: `glossary/index.md`
- Legacy path (this page): `00-core/03-glossary.md`

Content is unchanged; only the canonical path moved for clarity.
